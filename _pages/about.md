<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master's student in **Applied Computational Science and Engineering** at **Imperial College London** (2024‚Äì2025), currently conducting an **Individual Research Project (IRP)** in collaboration with **Google**, supervised by **Dr. Hide Matsuki**. Before this, I earned a **BSc in Applied Mathematics with Information Computing** from the **University of Birmingham**, graduating with **First-Class Honours**, and a **dual degree in Information and Computing Science** from **Jinan University (JNU)**, where I ranked **7th out of 66** with a **GPA of 3.96/4.25**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D reconstruction**, **implicit surface modeling**, and **AIGC (AI-Generated Content)**. I am particularly focused on enabling machines to better perceive, understand, and represent **3D space**. To deepen my understanding of this field, I have self-studied **Stanford's CS231A** and explored foundational topics in **SLAM** and **differentiable rendering**.

In 2024, I completed a research thesis titled **"Efficient Mesh Reconstruction from 3D Gaussians with L1 Regularization and Pruning"**, supervised by [Dr. Yizun Lin](https://cybsec.jnu.edu.cn/2023/1205/c39595a783433/page.htm), which explores sparse representations for mesh reconstruction based on **Gaussian splatting techniques**.

More broadly, I enjoy combining **computational geometry**, **deep learning**, and **vision-based modeling**, and I am passionate about building systems that bridge the gap between **geometry and generation**.

**[Learning Compositions of Primitives for 3D Shape Representation](https://github.com/kxhit/sdf-primitive)**  
**Zhishuo Liu**  
*Individual Research Project (IRP) - Industry-Academia Collaboration*  
*Supervised by Dr. Hide Matsuki, Google (Feb 2025 ‚Äì Present)  
Developed a novel 3D primitive-based shape reconstruction system integrating superquadrics and signed distance field learning. Reproduced methods from papers such as SuperDec and used a transformer-based point cloud clustering approach to guide primitive fitting for improved 3D shape representation and reconstruction accuracy.

**Aging Cause Analysis: Bayesian Analysis Based on Gompertz-Makeham Model**  
**Zhishuo Liu**  
*University of Birmingham Summer Research* (Jul 2023 - Oct 2023)  
Collected mortality data and patient information for major aging-related diseases in the United States, organized into 5-year interval format, and calculated conditional probabilities and related indicators. Applied Bayesian formulas to assess the impact of curing these diseases on human life expectancy, fitted the Gompertz-Makeham model, and determined constant mortality rate intervals for these diseases through hypothesis testing.

**DFT Triangle: A Novel Spectrogram Feature for Stock Price Prediction by CNN**  
Zhishuo Liu, Zichen Wang, etc.  
**Abstract**: Proposed a novel frequency-domain feature called DFT-triangle for stock price prediction, addressing the limitation of traditional DFT where similar price series exhibit distinct frequency features. The method stacks price series into 2D matrices with transferred frequency features, forming triangular patterns in scale-frequency coordinates. Evaluated on 470 stocks using CNN, DFT-triangle outperformed advanced sequential networks (Attention-LSTM, CNN-LSTM) and traditional econometric models (AR, ARIMA) in stock forecasting accuracy.
