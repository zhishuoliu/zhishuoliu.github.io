<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am about to pursue a Master's degree in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at Imperial College London for the 2024-2025 academic year.

Prior to this, I earned a BSc in Applied Mathematics with Information Computing from the University of Birmingham, graduating with 1st-class Honours (Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2024), and a dual degree from Jinan University (JNU) in Information and Computing Science, with a cumulative GPA of 3.96/4.25 (Ranked 7th out of 66).

I was an algorithm intern in the Virtual Human Division of the Central Research Institute at [CVTE](http://www.cvte.com/) (Guangzhou, China).

My research interests include 3D reconstruction and AIGC. I am dedicated to improving the computer's ability to understand and represent 3D space. To deepen my understanding of these topics, I have self-studied the [CS231A](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/course_notes.html) course and relevant SLAM knowledge. Under the guidance of [Dr. Yizun Lin](https://cybsec.jnu.edu.cn/2023/1205/c39595a783433/page.htm), I completed my thesis titled "Efficient Mesh Reconstruction from 3D Gaussians with L1 Regularization and Pruning."

We Implemented L1 regularization and updated the pruning strategy in SuGaR, achieving an ~18% reduction in training time and lower memory usage while maintaining accuracy.
