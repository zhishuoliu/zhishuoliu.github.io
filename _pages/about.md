<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master‚Äôs student in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at **Imperial College London** (2024‚Äì2025), with a strong academic foundation in applied mathematics, machine learning, and computer vision.

Previously, I earned a **BSc in Applied Mathematics with Information Computing** from the **University of Birmingham**, graduating with **First-Class Honours**, and a **dual degree in Information and Computing Science** from **Jinan University (JNU)**, where I ranked **7th out of 66** with a **GPA of 3.96/4.25**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D reconstruction**, **implicit surface modeling**, and **AIGC (AI-Generated Content)**. I am particularly focused on enabling machines to better perceive, understand, and represent **3D space**. To deepen my understanding of this field, I have self-studied **Stanford‚Äôs CS231A (Computer Vision: From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition)** and explored foundational topics in **SLAM** and **differentiable rendering**.

In 2024, I completed a research thesis titled **"Efficient Mesh Reconstruction from 3D Gaussians with L1 Regularization and Pruning"**, supervised by [Dr. Yizun Lin](https://cybsec.jnu.edu.cn/2023/1205/c39595a783433/page.htm), which explored sparse representations for mesh reconstruction based on **Gaussian splatting techniques**.

Previously, I interned as an **Algorithm Engineer** at the **Virtual Human Division** of the **Central Research Institute at [CVTE](http://www.cvte.com/)** in Guangzhou, China. During the internship, I worked on projects involving **LLM fine-tuning (via LoRA)** for stylized content generation, developed a **PPT-to-script generation API**, and contributed to **TTS data preparation pipelines**.

More broadly, I enjoy combining **computational geometry**, **deep learning**, and **vision-based modeling**, and I am passionate about building systems that bridge the gap between **geometry and generation**.
